## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

I learned a lot about Flexbox and how to make a responsive
layout. Using transform and translate in CSS to make offset
content is new to me, looking forward to trying more layouts
with it!


### Continued development

I want to come back to this challenge and use an API to get
all the users and their comments to dynamically load on the page,
I am excited about learning more on the backend.
